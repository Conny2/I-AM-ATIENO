        <P>I am Atieno, which means born at night when the sky was dark and all mammals that were created by ‘Obongo Were’   meaning God whom our ancestors believed to have been living beyond the skies were all a sleep apart from the Bat’s of cos, born in the village of kanyandoto the land of fresh wheat, maize, fruits such as {mapera and maembe} meaning guavas and mangoes, fresh water and not forgetting the fresh fish from the great Lake Victoria. A lot was going on at the time of my birth it was harvesting season, in the month of December when everyone from the city come home for the festive season. I was named after my two grand mothers who were Mary Atieno and Cornelia Awuor which for them it was love at first site.  My birth was one of a kind, I was the 'Mikayo' meaning the first child of the family.</P>

<P>After dropping out of school, life became so hard that I searched for work but without education or any qualifications, I ended up doing a commission job which did not add up to anything, I fell in love and got pregnant but later on, realized that I was all alone with my baby without a husband or let's say the man left huh.... yeah, my life took a turn but I fought it, being jobless and a Mother was so tough that I almost fell into depression, but I prayed each day in tears and God eventually opened doors for me</P>

<P>The year was 2020, when I came to the United Kingdom in January, I was a student without a work permit, but as an African girl I found myself working, I had to do something for myself, your girl was broke after I got my work permit, I did all jobs that were available in my areas of care, I worked in all sectors of care, I worked as a HEALTH CARER ASSISTANT, SUPPORT WORKER, CARE WORKER, MENTAL CARER, AND MATERNITY SUPPORT WORKER. I was hungry for money, I wanted to finish my school fees and give my son whom I left back home a good life, so a girl needed to work. I worked far and near my home, and I traveled around the east midlands in England just for work I did sleep shifts and wake-up calls, I had no social life, and no friends because my schedule could not accommodate any of them and that's how I learned to be alone, International student life in England is not for the faint-hearted, there are days I would cry myself to sleep, the journey was tough, every single thing that I wanted, came from my pocket. my means of transport were trains, taxis, and buses. I had a backpack which was my wardrobe,  I would attend my classes immediately after work because attendance was mandatory and very important to me. The struggle has not yet paid but I am happy with where I am because from the very first day to date it has been God.</P>
